A Pokemon-inspired game developed in my Advanced Programming Techniques class (Coms327). This project reinforced C++ fundamentals including pointers, curses library usage, and algorithm implementation. While not a complete game, it served as an excellent platform for learning complex programming concepts and memory management.

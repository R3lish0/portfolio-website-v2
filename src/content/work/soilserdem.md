SoilSerdem is a startup based in Ames, Iowa that helps farmers reinvent the way they handle their data. To them, I owe my ability to work well within a team of developers, work with teams of people who are not developers, delegate tasks, manage deadlines, and provide a low latency product. This position has required me to handle backend, frontend, databases, docker, AWS, and I keep learning more every day.
